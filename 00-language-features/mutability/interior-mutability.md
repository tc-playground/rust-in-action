# Interior Mutability

## Introduction

1. `Interior mutability` is a design pattern in Rust that allows you to mutate data even when there are immutable references to that data.

    * NB: Normally, this action is disallowed by the borrowing rules.

2. To mutate data, the pattern uses unsafe code inside a data structure to bend Rustâ€™s usual rules that govern mutation and borrowing.

> `mutable statics` are generally to be avoided. Instead, `interior mutability` should be sought. 

> The Rust `RefCell` pattern and `Unsafe Cell` primitive provide `interior mutability`.
